# pseudo-enum
Ever wish you could write your own enums on Roblox? This generates a script that kind of does that but not really.
This isn't an attempt to copy the enum API, however all of the functionality / use cases should be provided by the helper functions.

## config
To create the config file just enter this command in the console:
```sh
pseudo-enum init
```

## build
To construct the script just enter this command in the console:
```sh
pseudo-enum build
```
